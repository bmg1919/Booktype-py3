# Booktype

Booktype makes it easier and quicker for authors, companies and organisations to edit and publish books. It imports DOCX or EPUB files, converts them into single-source HTML for online editing and proofreading, and uses CSS Paged Media to produce good-looking output for print, the open web, and almost any ebook reader, in seconds. Booktype facilitates collaborative, agile production across time zones and borders.

Booktype is built on the [Django](https://github.com/django/django) web framework and many great [Python libraries](https://github.com/booktype/Booktype/tree/master/requirements).

The Booktype user interface is being [translated into many languages](https://www.transifex.com/sourcefabric/booktype) by our [community of contributors](https://github.com/booktype/Booktype/blob/master/AUTHORS.txt). Your help with development or translation is always welcome!

## Testing

Booktype uses the [py.test](https://docs.pytest.org/en/latest/) testing framework with the [pytest-django](https://pytest-django.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) plugin. It makes the testing process easier, and also provides the ability to run ready-made django (unittest) tests.

To run tests:

1. Open a terminal and activate the virtual environment (Booktype must be installed).
2. Go to (cd command) instance root (folder with manage.py and pytest.ini file).
3. Run the **py.test** command.
4. If you want pytest to print test coverage information, you should run **py.test --cov-report term-missing --cov=path/to/Booktype**.
You can read more about coverage here: [pytest-cov](https://pypi.python.org/pypi/pytest-cov)

## Python 3 update

### Why?

I saw booktype a few years ago and was intrigued. I tried to follow directions but just didn't have an easy time of it.
Being that the main repo is no longer maintained, options were limited. So I learned enough python 2 and 3 to make corrections to get it running.

### What?

The docker files should be enough to get a running production environment. The image is already large with the additions (I had some issues using python:3-slim) so I did not include calibre for mobi support. It has been depracated and epub is recommended by Amazon since 2022 anyway.

I did use most of the files from <https://github.com/booktype/booktype-docker.git> in addition to this forked repo. I have also updated most of the dependencies to be as up to date as pip-compile allows.

### What else?

There are still some issues in import/export that I want to sort out, mostly toc and styling. All of the tests currently pass without error or warning. I altered some string comparisons in favor of dict values.
